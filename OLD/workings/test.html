They require know how. \nOriginally, the system used to use letter grades from A-G, but now numbers are used in most parts of the UK. The highest grade is 9 and the lowest is 1; There is also a U for fail. The tests are taken in summer. \nThey include a mixture of a final test and course work. Is this always true? Well, in 2020 and 2021, because of COVID, no tests were given; instead, teacher assigned grades based on students' in-class performance. No wonder students did better than usual!
